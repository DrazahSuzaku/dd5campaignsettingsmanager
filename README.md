# dd5-campaign-introduction-manager
This application allows D&D5 Game Masters to have a protected space where their players can read the story introduction, character creation or house rules for the campaign or scenario they will play together.

## Motivation
This project is a prototype of a functionality for a set of applications to help game masters. It is also a training on Symfony 5. There is no user registration in this prototype as this is normally handled by another application. The data for character's creation is only the SRD.

## Tech/framework used
- Symfony 5

## Features
- Create a Campaign and asign a code to it.
- Edit your campaigh with custom texts for Introduction and Home Rules.
- Use SRD Templates to add options for Character Creation or add yours by editing the SRD JSON.
- Give the code to your players and they can access to your private Introduction for your adventure.
